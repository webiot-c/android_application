        After time passed after we received notifications, the colors of lists change.
        This is to decide the priority of notification based on the time passed after notification.<br>
        Colors change in the following step:<br>
        <br>
        <b><font color="#5433a7">[ Very short ]  %d minutes after received a notification</b></font><br>
        　<font color="#dddddd"><span style="background-color:#5433a7">Changes into the purple.</span></font> The same as 1st color in the above picture.<br>
        　Lifesaving from now might be very effective.<br>
        <br>
        <b><font color="#a50000">[ A little late ]  %d minutes after received a notification</b></font><br>
        　<font color="#dddddd"><span style="background-color:#a50000">Changes into the red.</span></font> The same as 2nd color in the above picture.<br>
        　A little time passed after received notification, but lifesaving may be helpful.<br>

        You can block notifications that occur far away. <br>
        This will allow you to see only the notifications that you can support lifesaving. <br>
        <br>
        Setting “0Km” disables this block function. <br>
        However, it is not recommended because you will receive all notifications regardless of distance. <br>
